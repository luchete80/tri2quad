Triangle to Quad Remeshing Algorithm
Input Triangular Mesh:

Load the triangular mesh, represented as vertices and connectivity (list of triangles).
Compute Adjacency Information:

For each triangle, find its adjacent triangles by checking shared edges.
Store adjacency information in a suitable data structure (e.g., hash map or edge-based adjacency list).
Identify Pairable Triangles:

For each triangle, check its adjacent triangles to find a pairable candidate:
Shared edge with exactly two vertices in common.
Suitable angles and areas to form a "good" quad.
Pairable criteria could be based on:
Aspect ratio (to avoid elongated quads).
Maximum edge length.
Minimize curvature mismatch between the two triangles.
Merge Triangles into Quads:

For each pairable triangle, merge the pair into a quad:
Replace the two triangles with a single quad.
The quad is defined by the four unique vertices of the two triangles.
Mark the processed triangles to avoid re-pairing.
Handle Leftover Triangles:

Some triangles may not be pairable due to geometric or topological constraints. Handle them by:
Keeping them as triangles.
Adding an extra vertex to convert them into a pseudo-quad (not ideal but useful for compatibility).
Validate and Optimize Mesh:

Ensure no overlapping elements or mesh artifacts.
Optionally, smooth vertex positions to improve element quality using Laplacian or other smoothing techniques.
Output Quad Mesh:

Export the updated mesh with quads and remaining triangles.

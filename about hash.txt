This code defines a custom hash function for a std::pair in C++ using a struct named PairHash. It's often used to enable the use of std::pair as keys in hash-based containers like std::unordered_map or std::unordered_set.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Code Breakdown
1. struct PairHash
A structure that serves as a functor (a callable object).
This struct is specialized for computing a hash value for a std::pair.
2. template <typename T1, typename T2>
A template declaration allows the hash function to work with pairs of any types T1 and T2.
3. std::size_t operator()(const std::pair<T1, T2>& pair) const
Defines the operator() method, making PairHash callable like a function.
It takes a constant reference to a std::pair as input and returns a std::size_t value, which is the computed hash.
4. return std::hash<T1>()(pair.first) ^ (std::hash<T2>()(pair.second) << 1);
This line computes the hash of the pair:
std::hash<T1>()(pair.first) computes the hash of the first element of the pair.
std::hash<T2>()(pair.second) computes the hash of the second element of the pair.
^ (bitwise XOR) combines the two hashes. XOR is commonly used because it helps spread out hash values evenly.
(std::hash<T2>()(pair.second) << 1) shifts the hash of the second element left by 1 bit. This reduces the chance of hash collisions by differentiating between (a, b) and (b, a).
5. const
Marks the function as const, ensuring it does not modify the state of the PairHash object.
Purpose
This custom hash function can be used to allow std::pair as a key in std::unordered_map or std::unordered_set, which require a hash function for key types. By default, std::pair does not have a predefined hash function.

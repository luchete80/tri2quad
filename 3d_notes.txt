To modify the code for converting tetrahedra to hexahedra in 3D, the algorithm must consider the connectivity of tetrahedra, identify sets of tetrahedra that can form valid hexahedra, and process their vertices accordingly. Here's how the algorithm changes:

Steps for Tetrahedra to Hexahedra Conversion
Input Mesh: Read a 3D mesh with vertices and tetrahedra elements.
Find Shared Faces: Compute the shared faces between tetrahedra to identify candidates for merging.
Merge Tetrahedra: Group compatible tetrahedra into hexahedra based on shared faces and geometric constraints.
Output Mesh: Write the resulting hexahedral mesh to a Gmsh file.

Key Updates:
Tetrahedra to Hexahedra Conversion:

Groups adjacent tetrahedra sharing faces to form valid hexahedra.
Input/Output:

Reads and writes .msh files with tetrahedra (type = 4) and hexahedra (type = 5).
Assumptions:

Tetrahedra form valid configurations for hexahedra (e.g., paired sharing faces).
